Hi, I'm Kiran (she/her)! I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the
University of Illinois Urbana Champaign, advised by [[https://dependenttyp.es][Talia
Ringer]]. Previously I completed my PhD from the National University of
Singapore advised by [[https://ilyasergey.net/][Ilya Sergey]] in [[https://verse-lab.github.io][VERSE Lab]].

My research focuses on the problem of proof maintenance: developing
newer and better tools for the maintenance and automation of formal
verification---the process of using computers to construct
mathematical proofs about the software correctness---and covers a
broad range of techniques, such as proof repair, invariant inference
or automated verification.

Notable highlights of my work include: producing the [[file:pdfs/ceramist-draft.pdf][first formally
verified proof]] of the probabilistic properties of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter][Bloom Filter]];
inventing [[file:pdfs/sisyphus-pldi23.pdf][proof-driven testing]], a novel technique that exploits
fundamental mathematical truths (the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence][Curry-Howard correspondence]]) and
enables repairing the proofs of real-world programs.

Other fun facts about me: I am a trans woman (egg cracked 12/2023,
started HRT 20/04/2024); I sometimes make [[https://kirancodes.itch.io/kirans-day-off][games]] in my free time ([[https://kirancodes.itch.io/][my
itch.io page]]), I'm a hobbyist artist and use [[file:art.org][artwork]] to capture
aspects of my lived experiences, and sometimes I write [[https://github.com/kiranandcode][code]].

# I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at University
# College London. In the past, I've worked in a range of CS disciplines,
# from the design of interoperable data formats to industrial machine
# learning for insurance companies, though my main focus now lies within
# the use of formal methods for reasoning about algorithms.
