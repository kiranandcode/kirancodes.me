* Building Static Websites for Dummies~ :html:webdev:

point of hints and tips and tricks for writing static webpages.

I am not a web-developer by trade, so I don't really keep up on the
latest developments in webdev that much, but recently I've been trying
to build a site, and in the process of looking up the best way to
prototype, I realised there were a lot of nifty tools and techniques
that I had been overlooking.
