I picked a random cafe on google maps, and travelled there and worked on the introduction for my PhD thesis. It was nice and calming and helped take my mind off how burnt out I felt, and how trapped I felt in Singapore.",

Instantly I felt so much at home, it was so nice not being like seen as a guy, being surrounded by people who weren't looking at me in a certain way. It was mostly east asian, so I was still a minority, but it was nice. Anyway, we went thrifting and then at the end of the night we headed to this bar. The owner got angry at us. We didn't do anything, we weren't loud (This was a group of semi-closeted queer people in SG, we were trying to be as innocuous as possible). Anyway she said that it wasn't profitable for us to be there and not order drinks and only food, and then sent us out. There wasn't even that many people in the bar, it was pretty empty so we kinda felt like transphobia might have been the cause. A fun experience at least. Rare from my time in Singapore.",

I think I pissed him off by recommending some youtube video essays, so he stopped sending me messages, but at the very least the recommendation was good. Very fun. This was a very productive day and I got a ton of my thesis done. I think working on the last chapter of my thesis. The cats were nice and would laze around. Apparently the cat who sat next to me and on my laptop doesn't usually warm up to strangers, so that made me feel nice. The place also had free hot chocolate refills which was amazing. It does smell a bit of cat pee though :(. Overall 10/10 definitely one of my more memorable cafe trips in Singapore. I definitely didn't feel as depressed at this point. I was also really close to finishing my thesis at this point and I had promised myself that I would start HRT after finishing my theisis and by the end of the month I had!",
