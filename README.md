# Kirancodes.me

This repository contains the source code for my personal website
[kirancodes.me](https://kirancodes.me).

I've been building my website using Org-mode since 2019, although I
recently redesigned it from scratch and so decided to make the source
public (this required some effort as before the site build was quite
entangled with my .emacs.d which changes frequently).

This repository might be helpful as a resource if you want to build
your own website using org-mode, but the build by itself might not
produce the same as mine as it require packages and languages only
required in my own .emacs.d.
